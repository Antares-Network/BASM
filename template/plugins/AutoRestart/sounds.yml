## This file will allow you to enable/disable sound effects in AutoRestart
## If the message AND the popup is disabled the sound will not play!

## Main Branch
sounds:
    ## This is the sound that is played when everyone receives a message.
    ## For example, an automated (Server restarting in 15 minutes) is a global broadcast
    broadcast:
        ## Enables or disables the sound
        enabled: true
    ## This is the sound that is played when a player requests information from the plugin.
    ## For example, when typing `/autore time`, this is a player requested popup.
    private:
        ## Enables or disables the sound
        enabled: true
    ## This is the dramatic restart sound that is played seconds before the server restarts.
    ## You can configure when the sound will start to play, "Its a little long and dramatic"
    shutdown:
        ## Enables or disables the sound
        enabled: true
        ## I recommend having it at 5 seconds, this is the perfect duration of the sound
        ## But if you want to make it earlier, that is up to you.
        seconds: 5
## DO NOT TOUCH!
