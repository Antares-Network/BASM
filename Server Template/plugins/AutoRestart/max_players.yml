## This will stop your server from shutting down if you have more than X amount of players configured in "amount".

## This is a beta feature. If you have any ideas, or recommendations about this feature you would like to
## add. Do not hesitate to message me on SpigotMC. I would love to hear what your think I should change/add!
## I love feedback and ideas.

## Main branch
max_players:
    ## Enable or Disable this feature
    enabled: false
    ## The max amount of players allowed for a restart. If you set this to 10, and your server has 11 people online
    ## your server will not shutdown until the amount of players is less than of equal to the amount set.
    amount: 10
    ## The delay for the server to restart once player count as been met.
    ## If players join the server during this delay, the server will continue to restart.
    ## This is in seconds
    delay: 10
    ## The timeout is the amount of time AutoRestart will give to the players to log out.
    ## If the amount is never reached within X minutes, then the server
    ## Will force restart. This prevents the server from never restarting due to high player traffic,
    ## but will give players time to wrap up their tasks.
    ## This is in minutes.
    timeout: 15
## DO NOT TOUCH!!
version: 4
